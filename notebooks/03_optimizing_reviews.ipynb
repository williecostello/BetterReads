    "# BetterReads: Optimizing the number of reviews\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores how many reviews are needed to achieve meaningful results with the BetterReads algorithm. We assume the general model framework laid out in the `01_modelling_with_use.ipynb` notebook and developed further in the `02_optimizing_kmeans.ipynb` notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have two basic exploratory goals. The first goal is to determine how few review sentences we need to have for our algorithm to work as intended, so as to know how big our review datasets need to be. The second goal is to investigate whether filtering reviews by their rating leads to more meaningful or less meaningful results. Obviously, these two questions are related, as both concern the impact of the size of our dataset on the results of our model."

    "## How many reviews does our algorithm need?\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus far we have been trialing our algorithm on fairly large datasets consisting of close to 10,000 reviews. Although plenty of books on GoodReads have this number of reviews, not all do, especially newer books. Furthermore, our web-scraping script can currently extract only up to 1,500 reviews for any given book. While we have access to larger datasets through UCSD Book Graph, these reviews are a few years old now, and limited in their scope. Ideally we would want our algorithm to be able to produce meaningful results for any book it is given, and to do so it must be able to work on smaller sets of reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sampling sentences\n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach here will be as follows. Rather than simply seeing how our algorithm performs on smaller datasets directly, we will see how it performs on progressively smaller samples of a known larger dataset. This way we will have a sense, from its performance on the original dataset, of what results we should expect. If the algorithm starts to output drastically different results below a certain sample size, we can take this an indication that the sample size is too small.\n",

The only truly new sentiments captured here are generic ones: that the book didn't match expectations, and that people simply didn't like the book.\n",
